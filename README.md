## Building a Distributed Queue System Based on Redis

- Golang: [install link](https://go.dev/doc/install)  
- Redis: [install link](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)

---
After installing Go and Redis, build the project named "COMP47250-Team-Software-Project".

This cmd directory contains the code that starts the main application, usually the `main.go` file.

- **pkg:** is used to store code that can be imported by other projects.

- **internal:** is used to store code that can only be imported by this project.

- **config:** is used to store configuration files for various environments.

- **scripts:** contains scripts, such as deployment or database migration scripts.

- **tests:** contains all the test code, which may include unit tests and integration tests.

The tests directory contains all the test code, which may include unit tests and integration tests.

## How to Run
```bash
go run main.go   
```
Run command above on ternimal in the root folder.
